# Shoe Inventory Management Program

This Python program helps the clerk in the shoe store to keep track of the shoes in the store and for management

## Description

This program reads from the text file inventory.txt and perform actions on the data, to prepare for presentation to managers.

We use a class named Shoes with the attributes: country, code, product, cost, and quantity.

Inside this class we define methods:
* get_cost - Returns the cost of the shoes.
* get_quantity - Returns the quantity of the shoes.
* __str__ - Returns a string representation of a class.

Outside the class we create a variable with an empty list to store a list of shoes objects.

We also defined the following functions outside the class:

* read_shoes_data - This function opens the file inventory.txt and read the data from this file, 
      then we create a shoes object with this data and append this object into the shoes list. 
      One line in this file represents data to create one object of shoes. 
      We use the try-except in this function for error handling. 

* capture_shoes - This function will allow a user to capture data about additional shoes and use this data to 
      create a shoe object and append this object inside the shoe list.

* view_all - This function will iterate over the shoes list and print the details of the shoes returned from the __str__ function. 
      We organise the data in a table format by using Pythonâ€™s tabulate module.
      
* re_stock - This function will find the shoe object with the lowest quantity, which is the shoes that need to be re-stocked. 
      We ask the user if they want to add this quantity of shoes and then update it. 
      The quantity is also updated on the file for this shoe.

* search_shoe - This function searches for a shoe from the list using the shoe code and return this object so that it will be printed.

* value_per_item - This function calculates the total value for each item. 
      The information is printed on the console for all the shoes.
      
* highest_qty - This code to determines the product with the highest quantity and print this shoe as being for sale.
